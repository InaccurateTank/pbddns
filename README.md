# pbddns

pbddns is a simple client for the updating of dynamic IPs on subdomains using the Porkbun API. It uses a config file to store the API keys and for securities sake can not create or remove subdomains.

The files in releases are for Linux amd64. I'm exceptionally bad at figuring out cross-compiling, so that's about as far as things are going to go for now.
